When I was working as a Software Developer embeded in an SDET team to provide them with quick and simple reporting tools. The army of REST API testers wanted our stake holders to access test results that we had gotten calling into our REST API. I proceeded to build a quick and easy small web app that upon deployment mount the test result logs human readable format which included pagination to the static folder of the app using Docker then proceeded to boot up this Flask app when a run of a suite of the REST API or all the suites of REST API tests had completed.  This is a very small web app and very useful especially if your testing framework intrinsically provides HTML output results.
